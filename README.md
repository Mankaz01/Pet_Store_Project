# Pet_Store_Project


The website will allow users to view, create, update, and delete pet listings available for purchase. Users can interact with the pet database to manage available pets. Each pet listing will have details like species, breed, age, price, and additional information relevant to potential buyers.

CRUD Operations

1. Create:
- Functionality: Authorized users (e.g., admin, pet sellers) can add new pet listings to the website.
- Details: Users can provide information such as pet name, species, breed, age, price, description, and images when creating a new pet entry.
- Example: A user adds a new pet listing for a "Golden Retriever" with details about age, price, and temperament.

2. Read:
- Functionality: Any visitor can browse through the list of pets available for purchase.
- Details: Users can view detailed information for each pet, including species, breed, age, and price.
- Example: A visitor views a list of all available pets or searches for a specific breed like "Labrador" to see the options.

3. Update:
- Functionality: Authorized users can update the details of existing pet listings, such as changing the price or adding additional information.
- Details: Users can edit fields like pet name, age, breed, price, description, and images if the pet listing requires updates.
- Example: A user updates the price of a "Siamese Cat" due to a sale or changes the description to include more information on the petâ€™s personality.

4. Delete:
- Functionality: Authorized users can remove pet listings from the website if the pet is no longer available for purchase.
- Details: Removing a pet listing will delete all related information and make the pet unavailable on the website.

These CRUD operations will allow full management of the pet listings, ensuring the website stays current and accurate with available pets for purchase.
